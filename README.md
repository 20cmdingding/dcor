dcor: distance correlation and distance covariance in Python.

Distance covariance and distance correlation are
dependency measures between random vectors introduced in 
[doi:10.1214/009053607000000505](doi:10.1214/009053607000000505).

This package offers functions for calculating several statistics
related with distance covariance and distance correlation, including
biased and unbiased estimators of both dependency measures.
